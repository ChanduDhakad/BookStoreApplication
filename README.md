Masai Book Store Application
This project is a RESTful web application for a book store that allows users to register, login, add books to their cart, purchase books from their cart, refresh their cart, delete an author (including all books by that author from the record and cart), and analyze the most number of unique books that the logged-in user can buy within their budget and add them all to the cart.

The project uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve user, book, author, and cart information. Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA are used to build and manage the APIs, while Spring Security is used to implement authentication for verifying user credentials.
